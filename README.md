**Quarter** Summer 2025
**Professor** Dr. Anil Chaturvedi
**Team Members** Ayoola Ogunbona, Cody Padlo

This course consisted of nine group projects, a midpoint deliverable, and a final. The objective of the course is to learn and demonstrate proficiency in applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in Python.
All projects require analysis and model development for a specific Kaggle dataset, and submissions to Kaggle were made for model evaluation.  
A free-tier Google Colab notebook was used for code development.
