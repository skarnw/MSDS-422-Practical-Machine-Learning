**Quarter** Summer 2025
**Professor** Dr. Anil Chaturvedi
**Team Members** Ayoola Ogunbona, Cody Padlo
<br><br>
This course consisted of nine group projects, a midpoint deliverable, and a final. The objective of the course is to learn and demonstrate proficiency in applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques in Python. <br>
All projects require analysis and model development for a specific Kaggle dataset, and submissions to Kaggle were made for model evaluation.  <br>
A free-tier Google Colab notebook was used for code development. <br>
